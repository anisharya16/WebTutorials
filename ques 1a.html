<h1>The Story In The Book</h1>
<h4>Chapter 1</h4>
Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature,New Scientist</i> and all the other scientific journals
her work had appeared in,was a well<br>thumbed copy of <i>On The Road</i>. It Had Been Molly's favourite book since college,and the longer she spent in these four walls
the more she felt she needed to be free.<br>

<p>She had spent the last three years in this room,sitting under a poster of an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that 
"Work is the refugee of the people who have nothing better to do". Although many considered her<br>
pioneering work,unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement,<i>Molly did </i> think she had something better to do.
